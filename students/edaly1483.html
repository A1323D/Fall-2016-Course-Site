            <h1>AI Patents</h1>
            <h3>A short presentation on AI Patents</h3>
            <p>AI Patents developed a conceptual search engine that addresses the challenge
              that the same idea can be described in multiple ways. For example, a coffee
              cup can be described as a mug, or as a container that holds liquid. The
              traditional way of searching forces the user to select small number of
              keywords, and to deeply understand the alternative keywords that could
              have been used to describe the same idea. Often times, inventors describe
              their inventions using “novel” terms to mitigate textual overlap with past
              invention and reduce the likelihood that patent application is rejected
              by the patent examiner. To address this challenge, AI Patents developed
              a search process that “learns” from thousands of patent examination decisions.
              These decisions determine that two distinct inventions describe the same
              scientific idea, even though their exact wording differs.</p>

                    <p>Erin Daly is a second year evening student at Suffolk Law School. &nbsp;By
                      day, Dr. Daly is a technical specialist at McCarter &amp; English, LLP
                      where her practice focuses on US and foreign patent preparation and prosecution,
                      freedom-to-operate analyses, and patent landscape analyses in the fields
                      of organic chemistry, medicinal chemistry, and pharmaceuticals. Dr. Daly’s
                      technical expertise spans a number of sub-disciplines including small molecule
                      total synthesis, parallel synthesis, structure-activity-relationship (SAR)
                      analysis, hit-to-lead optimization, and drug development and discovery.
                      Dr. Daly completed her postdoctoral studies in the Guy laboratory at St.
                      Jude Children’s Research Hospital where her research was funded in part
                      by a fellowship from the Hartwell Foundation. Her efforts were directed
                      towards developing novel therapeutic agents for targeting the assembly
                      of the transcriptional activation complex by the androgen nuclear hormone
                      receptor. Prior to her postdoctoral work, Dr. Daly earned her Ph.D. in
                      the laboratory of Professor Richard E. Taylor at the University of Notre
                      Dame where her work was funded by fellowships from the Lilly Foundation
                      and the ACS Division of Organic Chemistry. Her dissertation studies provided
                      biophysical evidence for the bioactive conformation of the epoxide/olefinic
                      region of the epothilone class of natural products.</p>
